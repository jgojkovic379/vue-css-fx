To run locally, `npm install` then `npm run dev`.

Alternatively You can also use [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) ( a free online IDE that will automate your dev setup ) for running the project with a single click. It will launch a ready to code VS Code workspace with the dependencies pre-installed and the web server running so that you can start hacking around without wasting any precious time on development setup.
